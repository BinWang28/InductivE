<p align="center">

</p>

In this repo, we mainly provide the following things:
1. Original dataset for CKG completion. (CN-100K, CN-82K, ATOMIC)
2. New dataset splits for inducitve CKG completion evaluation. (CN-82K-Ind, ATOMIC-Ind)
3. Example code to train and evaluate. (Textual feature + GCN (with iterative graph densifier) + ConvE)

For more details, please refer to our paper: [Inductive Learning on Commonsense Knowledge Graph Completion ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09263.pdf) published on [IJCNN-2021](https://www.ijcnn.org/).

# Datasets

All datasets are provided in this Repo. 

You can find the five datasets in folder ['dataset_only'](./dataset_only). Each dataset contains three files corresponding to 'train', 'validation', and 'test'.

For ATOMIC-related datasets, the triples are organized as 'head-relation-tail'.

For CN-related datasets, the triplets are organized as 'relation-head-tail'. 

# Example Code to Train and Evaluate

## Model

<p align="center">
<img src="img/2.png" alt="img/2.png" class="center" width="900">
</p>

Our model contains several steps:
1. Extract feature for each node (provided in the following google drive / baidu disk link.)
2. Model Training and Evaluation 
   1. Feature Extractor.
   2. Relational Graph Convolutional Network.
   3. ConvE Decoder for triplet prediction.
   4. Iterative graph densifier to provide more synthetic links for unseen entities.

## Requirements:
- pytorch=1.4.0
- dgl-cuda10.1
- numpy
- transformers=2.9.1

## Dataset files and pre-computed embeddings

To run our model, we pre-extract embedding features for each node using BERT and fastText methods. To download the feature files:
